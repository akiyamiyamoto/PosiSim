v0901 created 2021-10-06
  First geometry for Fluka4-1.1/Flair-3.1, copied from v0810


# ########################################################
v0810 created 2020-05-29

  For study of target replacement from upstream.
  Updated from v0803 code.
  Material data file is obtained from v0807

# ########################################################
v0807 created 2020-03-01

  Investigate shield thickness required for traget replacement

# ########################################################
v0806 created 2020-02-14

  Upward replacement case. Study radiation when upper shield 
  is removed after irradiation. FC magfield is default OFF 

# ########################################################
v0805 created 2020-01-31

  Study energy deposit to FC, including FC magnetic field.

v0804 created 2020-01-08

Geometry for vertical replacement scenario


# ########################################################
v0803 created 2019-12-10

Include empty space for RF tube, vacuum pump, etc.

v0802 created 2019-12-03  

Target to FC gap is now 2mm.
Refine v0801 geometry. Inner radius of CastIRON Shield was 
enlaged to be same as v0607. X position of rotation target 
and FC are reverted.i  Included geometry for a study of radiation 
after beam irradiation ( decay )

# ########################################################
v0801 created 2019-11-21  

Reduce number of cavities from 36 to 6 for more detail 
study arround target area.  In addition, trying to make code 
compatible with python3

# ########################################################
v0702 created 2019-10-08 

Extend the number of RF section, so as to cover down to Z=60m,
which is the end of Geant4 data from Fukuda san.

# ########################################################
v0701 created 2019-10-01 

  For a simulation of Fukuda's Geant4 data, geometry data was updated 
to be compatible with his geometry.  Downstream surface of W-Re target 
is taken as Z=0. Other components are shifted and accelerator cavity geometry 
was modified. The source input was taken from v0607 geometry

# ########################################################
v0608 created on Fri Jul 12 15:21:50 JST 2019

  For a comparison with a previous results, distnace between rotating disk 
and vacuum chamber was set to effectively 0 ( actually 10um ) and water 
inside the roatating disk is changed to Copper.

# ########################################################
v0607  2019-07-11

  For comparison with a previous estimation of energy deposit 
arround rotation target, geometry near rotation axis were modified 
and vaccum is filled by massive material.

# ########################################################
v0606  2019-06-20 

 This geometry was prepared from v0604, modifying
the thickness of the axis for target rotation and its
cooling pipe based on a suggestion by hardware developper.
create_target.py was changed as well to fix a bug found by 
the changes of geometry parameters.
