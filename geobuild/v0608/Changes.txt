v0608 created on Fri Jul 12 15:21:50 JST 2019

  For a comparison with a previous results, distnace between rotating disk 
and vacuum chamber was set to effectively 0 ( actually 10um ) and water 
inside the roatating disk is changed to Copper.

v0607  2019-07-11

  For comparison with a previous estimation of energy deposit 
arround rotation target, geometry near rotation axis were modified 
and vaccum is filled by massive material.

v0606  2019-06-20 

 This geometry was prepared from v0604, modifying
the thickness of the axis for target rotation and its
cooling pipe based on a suggestion by hardware developper.
create_target.py was changed as well to fix a bug found by 
the changes of geometry parameters.
