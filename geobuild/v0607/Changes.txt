  For comparison with a previous estimation of energy deposit 
arround rotation target, geometry near rotation axis were modified 
and vaccum is filled by massive material.

# ########################################################
v0606  2019-06-20 

 This geometry was prepared from v0604, modifying
the thickness of the axis for target rotation and its
cooling pipe based on a suggestion by hardware developper.
create_target.py was changed as well to fix a bug found by 
the changes of geometry parameters.
